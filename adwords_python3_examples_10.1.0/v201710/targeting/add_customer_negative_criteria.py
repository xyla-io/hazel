"""This example adds various types of negative criteria to a customer.

These criteria will be applied to all campaigns for the customer.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.

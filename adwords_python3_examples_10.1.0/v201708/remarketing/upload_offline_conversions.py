"""Imports offline conversion values for specific clicks into your account.

To get the Google Click ID for a click, run a CLICK_PERFORMANCE_REPORT. To set
up a conversion tracker, run the add_conversion_trackers.py example.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
section of our README.

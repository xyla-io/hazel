"""Adds a feed that syncs feed items from a Google My Business (GMB) account.

This example associates the feed with a customer.

The LoadFromStorage method is pulling credentials and properties from a
"googleads.yaml" file. By default, it looks for this file in your home
directory. For more information, see the "Caching authentication information"
